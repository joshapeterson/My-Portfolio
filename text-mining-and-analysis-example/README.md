# Text Analysis and Mining Example

## Overview

I was invited to give a talk to the M.S. in Data Science and Business Analytics program's Advanced Business Analytics class to discuss text mining and analysis methods. During the talk, an example of how to apply various text mining and analysis methods to Twitter data was provided. The code from this talk can be found [here](https://github.com/joshapeterson/My-Portfolio/blob/main/text-mining-and-analysis-example/text-analysis-and-mining-example_code.ipynb).
