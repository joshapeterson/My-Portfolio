### Overview

I was invited to give a talk to the M.S. in Data Science and Business Analytics program's Advanced Business Analytics class to discuss text mining and analysis methodologies. During the talk, an example of how to apply various text mining and analysis methodologies to Twitter data was provided. The code from this talk can be found [here](https://github.com/joshapeterson/My-Portfolio/blob/main/text-mining-and-analysis-example/text-analysis-and-mining-example_code.ipynb).
