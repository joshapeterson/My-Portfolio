# Detecting COVID-19 Misinformation on Social Media

## Overview

**Goal of Project**: Develop a machine learning model to accurately detect COVID-19 misinformation on X (formerly Twitter). 

The purpose of this project was to create a machine learning model that accurately detects COVID-19 misinformation on social media. The final developed deep learning model acheived an accuracy of 95%. This model could be deployed on a platform such as Twitter to detect COVID-19 related misinformation posted on the platform. 

***Model Results***

This model acheived an accuracy of 95%. The following is a classification report from the model:

A confusion matrix shows that the developed model is able to quite accurately detect if the content of a tweet contains misinformation or accurate information.

***Future Work***

The developed model was saved with the goal of deploying the model in the future.
